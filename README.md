# C-Fibonacci-series
Reinforce  understanding of flow-control structures.

Problem description
• Option A: Your program must output the following sequence (the number of terms in
the sequence is given by the user): 2, 4, 4, 8, 6, 12, 8, 16, 10, 20, 12, 24, 14, 28, 16,
32, 18, 36, 20, 40, ...
• Option B: Your program must allow the user to specify all of the parameters for a
counting sequence by asking the user for the following:
o a starting value
o a stopping value
o a step value
Your program must then display the resulting sequence. For example if the user enters
0 ,10, and 2 the sequence must be: 0 2 4 6 8 10
• Option C: Your program must count the number of alphabetic characters (both upper
and lower case) in a string input by the user.
• Option X: The program must exit.
